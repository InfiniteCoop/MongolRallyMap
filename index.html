    <h2>Crossing the Rubikhan: England to Mongolia</h2>
    <p>Next summer, four friends – Cooper, Keshav, Nick, and Benjie – will drive 10,000 miles from England to Mongolia to fundraise for, and raise awareness of, two important charities: the Cool Earth Foundation, which is dedicated to rainforest preservation, and SOS Children's Villages, which provides foster care for orphaned or abandoned children in destitute communities.</p>
    <p>This map traces team Crossing the Rubikhan's route from start to finish, identifying many of the notable sites and cities that they'll visit along the way. Follow along, and join in the adventure!</p>
    <small class='scroll'>Scroll ▼ to begin!</small>
  </section>

  <section id='hyde'>
   <h2>Hyde Park</h2>
&nbsp;
<p> Hyde Park is one of the largest parks in London and the starting point of the 2014 Mongol Rally! 200 cars carrying 500 insane people will caravan out of the city of London and into the biggest adventure of their lives. </p>
&nbsp;
<p> <strong> Projected Progress </strong> This is it. Where it all begins. Our car will be in tip-top shape, we’ll all be friends, and a potent combination of adrenaline and sheer dread will be coursing through our veins. </p>
&nbsp;
<p> <strong> Fun Fact </strong> They drive on the left side of the road in the UK. So we’re screwed. </p>
 </section>

  <section id='dover'>
   <h2>Dover</h2>
&nbsp;
<p> Dover is a coastal town in Southeast England and a major ferry port for crossing the English Channel (and sometimes the Rubikhan). </p>
&nbsp;
<p> <strong> Projected Progress </strong> Finally—we reach the end of driving on the wrong side of the road. Cheapskates that we are, we will take the boring car ferry instead of the supercool Chunnel, which I believe is a portmanteau of the words “cheese” and “funnel.” </p>
&nbsp;
<p> <strong> Fun Fact </strong> “Cliffs of Dover” may be an impressive nearby landform, but it is better known as the song that Nick could never beat on Expert in Guitar Hero. </p>
 </section>

 <section id='calais'>
   <h2>Calais</h2>
   &nbsp;
<p> Calais is our gateway to France. It is another major port town on the other side of the Channel. The daily mean temperature in July is 63F. So a little cooler than DC but a little warmer than Hanover. Awesome! </p>
&nbsp;
<p> <strong> Projected Progress </strong> Hello mainland Europe and what should be the easiest part of the Rally! We’re going to forgo the sights (how Calais of us) and cruise onwards towards Germany and Prague as quickly as possible. </p>
&nbsp;
<p> <strong> Fun Fact </strong> Calais is actually an artificial island, which is good because we are artificial people with artificial hopes and dreams. </p>
 </section>

 <section id='ghent'>
   <h2>Ghent</h2>
   &nbsp;
<p> This city is beautiful. It’s the Belgian version of Amsterdam with picturesque Dutch style row houses and interlocking canals. </p>
&nbsp;
<p> <strong> Projected Progress </strong> I’m sure it will look great from the window of our car as we cruise through in hopes of making the next day’s Launch Party. </p>
&nbsp;
<p> <strong> Fun Fact </strong> People from Ghent are called “Rope Bearers” because they rebelled against some King who punished them by making them wear ropes. How humiliating! </p>
 </section>

 <section id='nuremberg'>
   <h2>Nuremberg</h2>
&nbsp;
<p> Located in central Germany, Nuremberg is a classic European city with castles, a walled city center, and beer that is probably a little too expensive. </p>
&nbsp;
<p> <strong> Projected Progress </strong> Boring! By now we’ll be itching to get out of Western Europe and into the weirdness of the post-soviet world. </p>
&nbsp;
<p> <strong> Fun Fact </strong> The official language of Germany is German, which Nick took for three nonconsecutive terms in order to wreck his GPA. </p>
 </section>

 <section id='klenova'>
   <h2>Klenova</h2>
   &nbsp;
<p> This tiny Czech hamlet is utterly uninteresting other than being the site of the Official Czech Out Launch Party. </p>
&nbsp;
<p> <strong> Projected Progress </strong> Cooper, Keshav, and Nick will relive their Geography FSP glory days by getting inappropriately drunk on a farm in the middle of nowhere. Shout out to Professor Mollett and Farm Party 2012!</p>
&nbsp;
<p> <strong> Fun Fact </strong> Despite its global reputation, Klenova is often confused for a big field. Even by people who have lived there for generations. </p>
 </section>

 <section id='prague'>
   <h2>Prague</h2>
   &nbsp;
<p> Prague is well known for being The Greatest City In The World, but it in fact has problems like any other. For instance, sometimes a half-liter of delicious beer will run you as much as $1.50 in the city center, as opposed to the usual $1. Also the sunset over Charles Bridge is occasionally obscured by clouds and thus only sort of spectacular. Oh yeah, and the faceless baby sculptures can be utterly terrifying. </p>
&nbsp;
<p> <strong> Projected Progress </strong> For three out of four RubikhanArtists, this is where it all began. We discovered our love for adventure and for each other as we spent ten weeks exploring the narrow corridors, weird art, and funny Czech dive bars of the city’s hidden corners. </p>
&nbsp;
<p> <strong> Fun Fact </strong> The Czech Republic has the strongest economy AND the most equine statues in Central Europe.  </p>
 </section>

<section id='vienna'>
   <h2>Vienna</h2>
&nbsp;
<p> Vienna is the capital and largest city of Austria. It is a nexus of culture, the arts, and food that is way too expensive. Vienna is known as the “City of Music,” having been home to famous composers like Mozart, Haydn, Beethoven, and Bonzo the Guitar Playing Chimpanzee (citation needed). </p>
&nbsp;
<p> <strong> Projected Progress </strong> Benjie hopes that his standard uniform of a dirt covered t-shirt, ripped shorts, and Toms (along with his seldom used royal title) will be sufficient to secure an invite to one of the renowned Viennese Balls. </p>
&nbsp;
<p> <strong> Fun Fact </strong> Austria is the second cousin, once removed of Australia, another well-known country.  </p>
 </section>

<section id='zagreb'>
   <h2>Zagreb</h2>
   &nbsp;
<p> Zagreb is similar to Vienna because it is the capital and largest city of its own country. However, this time the country is Croatia. In fact, Zagreb looks remarkably similar to the other Central-European capitals on the route (Prague and Vienna). Red roofs and church spires define a cityscape better suited for a Disney fairytale than for four grimy 22 year olds. </p>
&nbsp;
<p> <strong> Projected Progress </strong> The team will likely breeze through Zagreb en route to the stunning Croat coast—sure to be a relaxing highlight before d(r)iving into the less politically stable regimes of the next few thousand miles. </p>
&nbsp;
<p> <strong> Fun Fact </strong> Zabreb is least alphabetical capital in the world—narrowly beating out Armenia’s alphabetically challenged capital, Yerevan.  </p>
 </section>

 <section id='split'>
   <h2>Split</h2>
&nbsp;
<p> Split is a coastal city in the Croatian region of Dalmatia. The city has an impeccable climate and is a popular summer tourist destination due to its location on the pristine Adriatic Sea. </p>
&nbsp;
<p> <strong> Projected Progress </strong> The team will be sure to take an afternoon unwinding on the beach and exploring the nightlife, er sites, before heading down to equally idyllic Dubrovnik. </p>
&nbsp;
<p> <strong> Fun Fact </strong> Locals have given Split the nickname “The Most Beautiful City in the World.” This is likely because they have never been to White River Junction.  </p>
</section>

 <section id='dubrovnik'>
   <h2>Dubrovnik</h2>
&nbsp;
<p> The “Pearl of the Adriatic” is actually not the inside of an oyster but rather a small city! Dubrovnik is another sunny tourist town and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. </p>
&nbsp;
<p> <strong> Projected Progress </strong> While everyone will surely want to stay here forever, the open road calls us east and away from the safety net of touristed Europe.</p>
&nbsp;
<p> <strong> Fun Fact </strong> Dubrovnik has bedbugs. Good thing our team won’t be sleeping in beds! </p>
 </section>

 <section id='sofia'>
   <h2>Sofia</h2>
&nbsp;
<p> Continuing the capital and biggest city theme, Sofia fills that role for Bulgaria. The city has a distinct mix of medieval European and Communist-style architecture—with hints of Turkish influence from the East. Sofia is apparently horrible to drive in, with disorganized traffic and almost no parking. </p>
&nbsp;
<p> <strong> Projected Progress </strong> The team may not want to spend too much time here, as parking headaches are not exactly what we pictured when we imagined this ramshackle road trip across Eurasia.</p>
&nbsp;
<p> <strong> Fun Fact </strong> Sofia is one of only a couple of European capitals with a ski resort just nearby. It will not be open in July. </p>
 </section>

 <section id='istanbul'>
   <h2>Istanbul</h2>
&nbsp;
<p> Istanbul is the third largest city in the world and, with the possible exception of London, the absolute biggest urban area we’ll encounter on our journey. Straddling the Bosphorus waterway, Istanbul lies on the border of Europe and Asia. The street food and mosques are not to be missed—and for us, neither are the auto mechanics. </p>
&nbsp;
<p> <strong> Projected Progress </strong> Istanbul will be an important point of recalibration for Crossing the Rubikhan, as we’ll take a few days to fix any dings to our car and see the sites in this sprawling intersection of cultures and continents.</p>
&nbsp;
<p> <strong> Fun Fact </strong> They Might be Giants said it best: “Istanbul not Constantinople.” </p>
 </section>

 <section id='ankara'>
   <h2>Ankara</h2>
   &nbsp;
<p> Ankara is the capital of Turkey, located in the middle of the Anatolian plateau. The city is absolutely ancient, with archeological sites from at least seven different civilizations. </p>
&nbsp;
<p> <strong> Projected Progress </strong> Ankara is a bit of a detour, but will provide a much needed break from the raw heat of Turkey’s northern coastline and our minimally air-conditioned vehicle.</p>
&nbsp;
<p> <strong> Fun Fact </strong> Ankara has always been called Ankara, thus forfeiting any chance of having a They Might be Giants song named after them. </p>
 </section>

  <section id='goreme'>
   <h2>Göreme</h2>
   &nbsp;
<p> Göreme is a small town located in central Turkey’s famed Cappadocia region. The town is surrounded by and filled with the iconic “fairy chimney” rocks that give Cappadocia its eerily beautiful alien landscape. </p>
&nbsp;
<p> <strong> Projected Progress </strong> It would be a terrible shame to drive across Turkey and not stop to see these beautiful rock formations, or explore the ancient cities carved into the rock face. While not the most efficient way to cross Asia Minor, Crossing the Rubikhan has never really cared too much about efficiency.</p>
&nbsp;
<p> <strong> Fun Fact </strong> Hot air balloons are extremely popular in arid Cappadocia. However, they are not an effective means of transport and also not big enough to carry our car.
 </section>

 <section id='batumi'>
   <h2>Batumi</h2>
&nbsp;
<p> Batumi is a Black Sea port city in Southwestern Georgia—just on the other side of the Turkish border. Due to its subtropical climate and coastal location, Batumi is a popular tourist destination with beach front clubs that have been described by some locals as “bumping.” </p>
&nbsp;
<p> <strong> Projected Progress </strong> After traversing Asia Minor, Team Crossing the Rubikhan will be ready to indulge their touristy side by exploring the remains of the Gonio Fortress and feasting on acharuli khachapuri, a viking-boat shaped pizza thing with an egg in the middle. Your guess is as good as ours.  </p>
&nbsp;
<p> <strong> Fun Fact </strong> There is a high-speed hydrofoil between Batumi and Sochi. Trying to figure out if the Russian policeman’s choir will be performing “Get Lucky” while we’re there.
 </section>

<section id='tbilisi'>
   <h2>Tbilsi</h2>
&nbsp;
<p> The Georgian capital will forever sit in the shadows of Atlanta, a much more significant Georgian capital. Tbilisi pathetically touts its narrow, centuries old alleyways and lush courtyards, as if those were anywhere near as efficient as Atlanta’s 16 lane highways and massive concrete buildings. Tbilsi’s backdrop of the towering Caucuses pales in comparison to the traffic and smog that grace Atlanta’s cityscape. </p>
&nbsp;
<p> <strong> Projected Progress </strong> While Tbilsi is beautiful, we will use this chance to escape into the famed foothills of the Caucuses, making sure not to miss a swim in Lake Lisi, about half an hour out of the city.   </p>
&nbsp;
<p> <strong> Fun Fact </strong> Georgia is famous for its wine. This is perfect for Benjie, who is famous for his wine snobbery.
 </section>

  <section id='baku'>
   <h2>Baku</h2>
   &nbsp;
<p> The claim to fame of this Azerbaijani capital (according to Wikitravel) is that its annual average temperature is exactly the same as the average annual temperature of the Earth! There are also cool palaces and temples apparently. </p>
&nbsp;
<p> <strong> Projected Progress </strong> The Baku to Turkmenbashi ferry may be the most unpredictable stage of the entire Rally. This is because the passage across the Caspian to Turkmenistan is not really on a ferry at all. Cargo ships leave port once every couple of days—and they <strong> may </strong> have room for passengers. They also run on no set schedule at all and are often delayed for days, either in Baku or just outside the port in Turkmenbashi. So close!   </p>
&nbsp;
<p> <strong> Fun Fact </strong> Baku is 28 meters below sea level—the lowest national capital in the world. Well I had fun.
 </section>

 <section id='caspian'>
   <h2>Middle of the Caspian</h2>
   &nbsp;
<p> We felt this deserved its own marker since the boat ride itself will be such a ridiculous experience. In the 2-5 days that we will be on the cargo ship between Baku and Turkmenbashi, we should expect to see the most spectacular sunsets, maybe encounter Neft Daslari, a Russian deep sea oil rig that is the largest floating city in the world (~5,000 people), and stuff ourselves into a tiny compartment that will pass as our quarters. </p>
&nbsp;
<p> <strong> Projected Progress </strong> While the trip across the sea will be slow and arduous, we will appreciate the break from worrying about our car. Poker will be played and books will be read as we brace ourselves for Central Asia—where the adventure will truly begin. </p>
&nbsp;
<p> <strong> Fun Fact </strong> There is technically no food onboard for passengers , but if we give the crew chef ingredients and a couple packs of cigarettes, he’ll cook us a mean feast.
 </section> 

<section id='turkmenbashi'>
   <h2>Turkmenbashi</h2>
   &nbsp;
<p> Welcome to Turkmenistan: the weirdest country this side of North Korea. Turkmenbashi was previously called Krasnovodsk until Turkmenistan’s President for Life, Saparmurat Niyazov renamed himself “Turkmenbashi,” meaning “Leader of all Turkmen” and named this city, along with several others and the month of January after himself. </p>
&nbsp;
<p> <strong> Projected Progress </strong> Depending on our luck, we may be in and out of Turkmenbashi and cruising down to Ashgabat in no time. OR we could be delayed offshore for three days, held up at the border due to the extremely narrow window (five days) for Turkmen visas, and find ourselves having to memorize President Niyazov’s 300 page autobiography in order to gain ingress. </p>
&nbsp;
<p> <strong> Fun Fact </strong> Flights within Turkmenistan are heavily subsidized by their government—a ticket from Turkmenbashi to Ashgabat would cost roughly $14. But is it worth it?
 </section>

 <section id='ashgabat'>
   <h2>Ashgabat</h2>
   &nbsp;
<p> Turkmenistan’s national cult of crazy is naturally strongest in the capital. A 50 ft. golden statue of the dear President stands in the city center—and rotates to always face the sun. Other highlights include the world’s fourth tallest free standing flagpole, the Museum of Turkmen National Values and of course, the Turkmen Carpet Museum. </p>
&nbsp;
<p> <strong> Projected Progress </strong> Keshav’s love of flagpoles has made Ashgabat a can’t-miss destination of his since he was a boy, and the rest of Team Crossing the Rubikhan will be happy to oblige. However, the narrow window of our visas will keep the pressure on us to jump over to Uzbekistan as quickly as possible. </p>
&nbsp;
<p> <strong> Fun Fact </strong> Can you guess where the three tallest flag poles are located? Neither can we.
 </section>

  <section id='khiva'>
   <h2>Khiva</h2>
&nbsp;
<p> Khiva is an ancient Uzbek town and the formal capital of Khwarezmia—everyone’s favorite oasis. Khiva sits near the former shoreline of the Aral Sea, which has disappeared almost as quickly as the author’s attention span writing these blurbs.</p>
&nbsp;
<p> <strong> Projected Progress </strong> We may not reach Khiva—a far flung outpost from Ashgabat and Bukhara, our next destination. But if we do, we will make sure to check out the minarets and the lesser-known maxarets. </p>
&nbsp;
<p> <strong> Fun Fact </strong> The large blue tower in the center square was supposed to be a minaret, but the Khan stopped construction when he realized that, if completed, it would overlook his harem and the muezzin would be able to see the Khan’s wives.
 </section>

 <section id='bukhara'>
   <h2>Bukhara</h2>
   &nbsp;
<p> Located in the middle of a vast oasis, Bukhara is essentially a giant museum. There are over 140 monuments and the entire historic center has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. During the golden age of the Samanids, it was the intellectual capital of the Islamic world.</p>
&nbsp;
<p> <strong> Projected Progress </strong> Team Crossing the Rubikhan will take its time exploring this ornate gem in the middle of nowhere. Compared with Turkmenistan, the blue domes and ancient city streets will make us feel like Khalifas—of the Game of Thrones, not the “Wiz” variety.</p>
&nbsp;
<p> <strong> Fun Fact </strong> This is the first Wikitravel page we encountered where different restaurants and food shops were distinctly NOT recommended. Uh-oh.
 </section>

 <section id='samarkand'>
   <h2>Samarkand</h2>
   &nbsp;
<p> At first glance, Samarkand looks exactly like Bukhara and Khiva. This holds true at second and third glance too. Which is fine by us, all three cities are stunning. There are a bunch of mosques and tombs etc that are must-sees. However, pressed for time, we may not.</p>
&nbsp;
<p> <strong> Projected Progress </strong> We find it hard to believe that such a beautiful oasis exists between the unforgiving desert of Turkmenistan and the unforgiving but slightly cooler desert of Kazakhstan. The whole thing may just be a mirage with an impressive web/Google Earth presence, for a mirage that is. </p>
&nbsp;
<p> <strong> Fun Fact </strong> The Registan ensemble has a nightly "light show" that involves turning some flood lights on then turning them off ten minutes later—apparently a pretty underwhelming event.
 </section>

 <section id='tashkent'>
   <h2>Tashkent</h2>
   &nbsp;
<p> The capital and largest city in Uzbekistan, Tashkent is nicknamed the Stone City because many of the buildings are made out of—you guessed it—stone! It was once lined with beautiful trees and parks but the government initiated a thorough tree-cutting campaign in 2009. We think they had help from the bad guy in Captain Planet. </p>
&nbsp;
<p> <strong> Projected Progress </strong> On our last stop in Uzbekistan, we’re excited to see all the Soviet-erected monuments that were so missing from our study abroad experience in the Czech Republic—not to mention almost all of the cities we’ve passed through since France. </p>
&nbsp;
<p> <strong> Fun Fact </strong> Tashkent is an obscure portmanteau of my father’s name and the popular TV show, Tosh.O.
 </section>

  <section id='osh'>
   <h2>Osh</h2>
   &nbsp;
<p> Osh is the second largest and the second most capital city in Kyrgystan (unconfirmed). The city boasts the most crowded market in Central Asia. Impressive stuff, Osh. </p>
&nbsp;
<p> <strong> Projected Progress </strong> Osh is nestled in the northern Pamir Mountains with no railway connection to anywhere. It sits right up against the Uzbek border—not exactly the friendliest border in central Asia. So I guess getting into Kyrgyzstan through Osh will be an exciting feat. </p>
&nbsp;
<p> <strong> Fun Fact </strong> There is a three story yurt in the city center. And no, the stories are not the ground floor, the roof, and a person standing on someone’s shoulders on the roof.
 </section>

  <section id='bishkek'>
   <h2>Bishkek</h2>
   &nbsp;
<p> Bishkek is the capital and largest city of Kyrgystan. “The ‘kek” is a highly Soviet city with wide boulevards and marble-faced public buildings, along with a bunch of really depressing apartment blocks. Its not-cut-down tree-lined streets will provide much needed shade in the August heat. </p>
&nbsp;
<p> <strong> Projected Progress </strong> Bishkek is the first of two highly functional, highly Soviet, and lowly interesting major cities we’ll pass through in a matter of a day or two—the next being Almaty. This will be a great place to find a mechanic and get our car looked at, but probably not to spend too much time in. </p>
&nbsp;
<p> <strong> Fun Fact </strong> Kyrgystan has a refreshingly easy visa process, something that should never be undervalued. Looking at you, Russia.
 </section>

  <section id='almaty'>
   <h2>Almaty</h2>
   &nbsp;
<p> Almaty is the largest city in Kazakhstan but lost its capitalship (?) to far off Astana in 1997. It is easily the most developed and diverse city in Kazakhstan, whatever that means. The city sits at the seat of a huge mountain range to its south (one that we will be just avoiding). </p>
&nbsp;
<p> <strong> Projected Progress </strong> The biggest and only real city until Ulaanbaatar, Almaty is our last chance to stock up on equipment, supplies, and human interaction before facing a couple weeks of the open road. Good thing it’s extremely boring. </p>
&nbsp;
<p> <strong> Fun Fact </strong> There is no queuing etiquette at the Kyrg-Kazakh border. Apparently the thing to do is to stand your ground regardless of what other people say in order to get in front of you. So kind of like the Collis Café at lunch.
 </section>

  <section id='semey'>
   <h2>Semey</h2>
   &nbsp;
<p> Semey is a small city on the Kazakh-Russian border and our point of egress from the ‘Stans and into what is now Russia but—judging from current events—may soon become the USSR 2.0. It is culturally very Russian, to the point that its residents suffer sever health effects from longtime exposure to nearby atomic testing sites. </p>
&nbsp;
<p> <strong> Projected Progress </strong> Don’t worry, Mom and Dad, we will be getting out of this city and onto the Russian highways as soon as the border guards let us. </p>
&nbsp;
<p> <strong> Fun Fact </strong> Many of the descriptive passages in “The Brothers Karamazov” is based off of Dostoyevsky’s experience in Semey. That should tell you something.
 </section>

  <section id='barnaul'>
   <h2>Novosibirsk</h2>
   &nbsp;
<p> Somehow the middle of Siberia is home to Russia’s third largest city. Novosibirsk is not exactly a household name in America—maybe because it’s in the middle of nowhere and distinctly NOT a tourist city. Guess we didn’t get the memo. The primary industries are chemicals and hydroelectricity. Tourism comes 83rd. </p>
&nbsp;
<p> <strong> Projected Progress </strong> We may make the three hour detour up to Novosibirsk just to see Siberia’s largest city—but the smart money says we take advantage of the incredible highway system to get in and out of Russia as quickly as possible. Not the most stable place right now. </p>
&nbsp;
<p> <strong> Fun Fact </strong> This may be the largest city on Earth where almost no one speaks English. Probably not but there’s got to be some superlative there.
 </section>

  <section id='khovd'>
   <h2>Khovd</h2>
&nbsp;
<p> The “city” best known for its watermelon and tomato harvest, Khovd is more than meets the eye. Unless you’re standing in the nearby cemetery on the hillside, in which case it is exactly what meets the eye. </p>
&nbsp;
<p> <strong> Projected Progress </strong> After our first foray on the Mongolian “roads”—and we use that term liberally—Khovd will seem like a surreal metropolis full of modern day amenities like buildings and people. </p>
&nbsp;
<p> <strong> Fun Fact </strong> There is no “By Car” section on the Wikitravel page for how to get into Khovd. This should theoretically be alarming.
 </section>

  <section id='bayankhongor'>
   <h2>Bayankhongor</h2>
   &nbsp;
<p> Bayankhongor is the next sizable settlement on our trek across the Mongol steppe. Winter snow disasters, or “zud,” in the early 2000s devastated Bayankhongor’s economy, and demarcated a shift away from herding and towards moving to Ulaanbaatar. The same storms actually benefitted the ice economy of Keshav’s heart. </p>
&nbsp;
<p> <strong> Projected Progress </strong> Halfway across the steppe, things will hopefully be looking up as we prepare for our last push across the desert. Our car will be in shambles but our spirits should be high. </p>
&nbsp;
<p> <strong> Fun Fact </strong> The Bayankhongor province has the most marmots of any Mongolian province.
 </section>

 <section id='ulaanbaatar'>
   <h2>Ulaanbaatar</h2>
   &nbsp;
<p> The capital and largest (only) city in Mongolia, Ulaanbaatar is home to nearly half of Mongolia’s population. While it is an architectural monstrosity, the city more than makes up for it with its warm-hearted people and paved roads. Not to mention the wild finish line party waiting (just) for us. </p>
&nbsp;
<p> <strong>Projected Progress </strong> Fin. Done. Kaputt. We will have made it here only if we are extremely lucky. We don’t want to write anything else here for fear of jinxing the situation. </p>
&nbsp;
<p> <strong> Fun Fact </strong> Ulaanbaatar is the coldest capital in the world. The winter Mongol Rally is going to be a doozy.
